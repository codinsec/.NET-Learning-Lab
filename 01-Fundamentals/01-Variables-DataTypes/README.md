# 01 - Variables & Data Types

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This topic covers the fundamentals of working with variables and data types in C#. You'll learn how to declare variables, understand different data types, and perform type conversions.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Variable declarations (var, explicit types)
- Basic data types (int, double, string, bool, char)
- Nullable types
- Type conversions (implicit, explicit, Convert class)
- Const and readonly
- Var keyword and type inference
- Dynamic type

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Variable Declaration
Learn how to declare variables with explicit types or using the `var` keyword for type inference.

### Data Types
Understand the different numeric types (byte, short, int, long, float, double, decimal), text types (string, char), and boolean type.

### Type Conversions
Master implicit conversions, explicit casting, and using the Convert class for safe type conversions.

### Nullable Types
Learn how to work with nullable value types using the `?` operator.

## 🚀 Running the Examples

Navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
cd VariablesDataTypes.Sample
dotnet run
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
01-Variables-DataTypes/
├── README.md (this file)
└── VariablesDataTypes.Sample/
    └── Program.cs (examples and demonstrations)
```

## 🎓 What You'll Practice

- Declaring variables with different data types
- Using type inference with `var`
- Converting between types safely
- Working with nullable types
- Understanding const vs readonly
- String interpolation and formatting
