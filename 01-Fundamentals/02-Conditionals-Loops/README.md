# 02 - Conditionals & Loops

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Master control flow in C# by learning conditional statements and loops. This topic is essential for writing programs that make decisions and repeat operations.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- if/else if/else statements
- switch statements and switch expressions
- Ternary operator (? :)
- for loops
- foreach loops
- while and do-while loops
- break and continue statements
- Nested loops

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Conditional Statements
Learn how to make decisions in your code using if-else statements and switch expressions.

### Loops
Understand different loop types and when to use each:
- **for**: When you know the number of iterations
- **foreach**: Iterating over collections
- **while**: When condition is checked before execution
- **do-while**: When you need at least one execution

### Control Flow
Master `break` to exit loops early and `continue` to skip iterations.

## 🚀 Running the Examples

Navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
cd ConditionalsLoops.Sample
dotnet run
```
