# 04 - String, DateTime & Math

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Master string manipulation, date/time operations, and mathematical functions in C#. These are essential skills for real-world application development.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- String manipulation (concatenation, substring, replace, split)
- String formatting and interpolation
- StringBuilder for efficient string operations
- DateTime and TimeSpan operations
- Date formatting and parsing
- Math class operations
- String comparison methods

## 💡 Key Concepts

### String Operations
Learn how to manipulate strings efficiently:
- Concatenation and interpolation
- Searching and replacing
- Splitting and joining
- Formatting with different styles

### DateTime
Master date and time operations:
- Creating DateTime instances
