# 05 - Arrays & Collections

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Learn to work with arrays and collections in C#. This topic covers different collection types and when to use each one.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Arrays (single-dimensional, multi-dimensional, jagged)
- List<T> - Dynamic arrays
- Dictionary<TKey, TValue> - Key-value pairs
- HashSet<T> - Unique elements
- Queue<T> - FIFO (First In First Out)
- Stack<T> - LIFO (Last In First Out)
- LINQ basics (Select, Where, OrderBy)

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Arrays
Understand fixed-size arrays and their variations:
- Single-dimensional arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays (rectangular)
- Jagged arrays (array of arrays)

### Collections
Learn the different collection types:
- **List<T>**: Dynamic array, most commonly used
- **Dictionary<TKey, TValue>**: Fast key-value lookups
- **HashSet<T>**: Ensures unique elements
- **Queue<T>**: First-in-first-out data structure
- **Stack<T>**: Last-in-first-out data structure

### LINQ Basics
Introduction to Language Integrated Query for filtering, transforming, and querying collections.

## 🚀 Running the Examples

Navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
cd ArraysCollections.Sample
dotnet run
```
