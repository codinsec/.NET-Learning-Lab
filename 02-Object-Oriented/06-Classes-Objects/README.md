# 06 - Classes & Objects

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Learn the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming in C# by understanding classes and objects. This is the foundation of OOP where you'll learn to model real-world entities as classes.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Class declaration and definition
- Object instantiation
- Fields and properties
- Constructors (default, parameterized)
- Methods in classes
- Access modifiers (public, private, protected, internal)
- Static members
- Object initialization

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Classes
Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They define the structure and behavior of objects.

### Objects
Objects are instances of classes. Each object has its own state (data) and can perform actions (methods).

### Encapsulation
Learn how to encapsulate data and methods within classes using access modifiers.

### Constructors
Understand how to initialize objects using constructors with different parameters.

## 🚀 Running the Examples

Navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
cd ClassesObjects.Sample
dotnet run
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
06-Classes-Objects/
├── README.md (this file)
└── ClassesObjects.Sample/
    └── Program.cs (examples and demonstrations)
```

## 🎓 What You'll Practice

- Creating classes with fields and properties
- Instantiating objects
- Using constructors to initialize objects
- Understanding access modifiers
- Working with static members
- Object initialization syntax

## ➡️ Next Steps

After mastering classes and objects, proceed to:
- **07-Inheritance** - Learn how classes can inherit from other classes
