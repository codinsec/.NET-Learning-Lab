# 07 - Inheritance

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Master inheritance in C#, one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Learn how to create class hierarchies and reuse code through inheritance.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Base classes and derived classes
- Inheriting fields, properties, and methods
- Method overriding (virtual, override)
- base keyword
- Constructor inheritance
- Sealed classes
- Access modifiers in inheritance

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit members from another class, promoting code reuse and establishing relationships between classes.

### Base and Derived Classes
- **Base class**: The parent class that provides common functionality
- **Derived class**: The child class that inherits from the base class

### Method Overriding
Learn how to override base class methods in derived classes using `virtual` and `override` keywords.

### Constructor Chaining
Understand how constructors work in inheritance hierarchies using the `base` keyword.

## 🚀 Running the Examples

Navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
cd Inheritance.Sample
dotnet run
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```

## 🎓 What You'll Practice

- Creating class hierarchies
- Inheriting from base classes
- Overriding methods
- Using the base keyword
