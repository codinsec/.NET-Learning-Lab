# 09 - Polymorphism & Encapsulation

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Master polymorphism and encapsulation, two fundamental OOP principles. Learn how to write flexible, maintainable code that can work with objects of different types.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Polymorphism (compile-time and runtime)
- Method overloading vs overriding
- Virtual and override keywords
- Encapsulation with access modifiers
- Properties (auto-implemented, computed)
- Getters and setters
- Data hiding and abstraction

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type. It enables "one interface, multiple implementations."

### Types of Polymorphism
- **Compile-time (Static)**: Method overloading
- **Runtime (Dynamic)**: Method overriding with virtual/override

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), while hiding internal implementation details.

### Access Modifiers
- **public**: Accessible from anywhere
- **private**: Only accessible within the same class
- **protected**: Accessible within the class and derived classes
- **internal**: Accessible within the same assembly

## 🚀 Running the Examples

Navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
cd PolymorphismEncapsulation.Sample
dotnet run
```

## 📁 Project Structure

└── PolymorphismEncapsulation.Sample/
    └── Program.cs (examples and demonstrations)
```

## 🎓 What You'll Practice

- Implementing polymorphism through inheritance
- Using virtual and override keywords
- Understanding method overloading vs overriding
- Implementing proper encapsulation
- Using access modifiers effectively
- Creating properties with getters and setters
- Data validation through encapsulation
