# 16 - Reflection & Attributes

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Learn reflection and attributes in C#. Understand how to inspect types at runtime, access metadata, and use attributes to add declarative information to your code.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Reflection basics
- Type inspection
- Getting type information
- Accessing members (properties, methods, fields)
- Creating instances dynamically
- Custom attributes
- Reading attributes
- Attribute targets

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Reflection
Reflection allows you to inspect and manipulate types, properties, methods, and other members at runtime.

### Attributes
Attributes provide a way to add metadata to your code elements (classes, methods, properties, etc.).

### Common Uses
- Serialization/Deserialization
- Dependency injection frameworks
- ORM frameworks
- Validation frameworks
- API documentation

### Performance Considerations
Reflection has performance overhead. Use it judiciously and consider caching reflection results when possible.

## 🚀 Running the Examples

Navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
cd ReflectionAttributes.Sample
dotnet run
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
16-Reflection-Attributes/
├── README.md (this file)
└── ReflectionAttributes.Sample/
    └── Program.cs (examples and demonstrations)
```

## 🎓 What You'll Practice

- Inspecting types at runtime
- Getting type information
- Accessing properties and methods dynamically
- Creating instances using reflection
- Creating custom attributes
- Reading attribute metadata
- Using attributes for metadata

## ➡️ Next Steps

Congratulations! You've completed the Advanced C# section. Now proceed to:
- **04-DotNet-Ecosystem** - Learn about the .NET ecosystem, dependency injection, and configuration
