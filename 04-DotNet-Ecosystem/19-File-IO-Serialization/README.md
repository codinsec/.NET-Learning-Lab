# 19 - File I/O & Serialization

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Master file operations and data serialization in C#. Learn how to read/write files, work with streams, and serialize/deserialize data in different formats.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- File and Directory operations
- Reading and writing text files
- Working with streams (FileStream, StreamReader, StreamWriter)
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- Binary serialization
- Working with paths
- File system operations

## 💡 Key Concepts

### File I/O
File I/O operations allow you to read from and write to files on the file system.

### Serialization
Serialization converts objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted, while deserialization reconstructs objects from that format.

### JSON Serialization
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular text-based format for data exchange. System.Text.Json provides fast, efficient JSON serialization.

### Streams
Streams provide a way to read/write data sequentially, useful for large files or network operations.

## 🚀 Running the Examples

Navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
cd FileIOSerialization.Sample
dotnet run
```
