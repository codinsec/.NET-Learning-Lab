# 30 - SOLID Principles

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Master the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. Learn how to write maintainable, flexible, and testable code.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Real-world examples
- Benefits of SOLID principles
- Common violations and fixes

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change. Each class should have a single, well-defined responsibility.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Use inheritance and polymorphism.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Create specific interfaces.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## 🚀 Running the Examples

This is a class library project. You can reference it in other projects or create a console app to demonstrate usage.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🎓 What You'll Practice

- Understanding each SOLID principle
- Identifying SOLID violations
- Refactoring code to follow SOLID
- Writing maintainable code
- Applying SOLID in real scenarios
- Understanding design trade-offs

## ➡️ Next Steps

After mastering SOLID principles, proceed to:
