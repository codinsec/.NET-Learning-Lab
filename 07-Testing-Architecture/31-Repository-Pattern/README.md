# 31 - Repository Pattern & Design Patterns

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Master the Repository Pattern and other essential design patterns. Learn how to create maintainable, testable, and scalable architectures.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Repository Pattern
- Unit of Work Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Dependency Injection with patterns
- Pattern combinations

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Repository Pattern
Provides an abstraction layer between business logic and data access, making code more testable and maintainable.

### Factory Pattern
Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

### Strategy Pattern
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

### Observer Pattern
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified.

### Singleton Pattern
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## 🚀 Running the Examples

This is a class library project. You can reference it in other projects or create a console app to demonstrate usage.
